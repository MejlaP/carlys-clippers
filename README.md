# Carly's Clippers

## Codecademy project

### Python - Loops

Carlyâ€™s Clippers is the newest hair salon on the block. I have to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. I will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.

I have been provided with three lists: hairstyles, prices and last_week.

Each index in hairstyles corresponds to an associated index in prices and last_week.

For example, The hairstyle "bouffant" has an associated price of 30 from the prices list, and was purchased 2 times in the last week as shown in the last_week list. Each of these elements are in the first index of their respective lists.
